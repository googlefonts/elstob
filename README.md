New! Visit the [specimen page](https://psb1558.github.io/Elstob-font/) for a preview of Elstob 2, now nearing completion.

The Elstob font (named for the eighteenth-century Anglo-Saxonist [Elizabeth Elstob](https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-8761)) is based on the Double Pica commissioned by Bishop [John Fell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fell_(bishop)) in the seventeenth century. Elstob is designed as a webfont. Thus:
1. It is a variable font, with weights ranging from ExtraLight to ExtraBold, optical sizes from "Fine Print" (circa 6 points) to "Display" (circa 18 points or greater) and also a grade axis (1-500). (A non-variable desktop version is also available.)
2. Outlines have been kept simple to limit file size.
4. The intention of the font is to include everything in Unicode useful to a substantial number of medievalists, but the character set has been limited to around 1000 glyphs to keep file size reasonable. Many characters from the [Medieval Unicode Font Initiative](https://skaldic.abdn.ac.uk/m.php?p=mufi), present in the designer's [Junicode](https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-New/tree/master/legacy) font, can be represented with combining diacritics.

Visit the [specimen page](https://psb1558.github.io/Elstob-font/) to see how a variable font works and put Elstob through its paces.

I'll share new developments on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/InPbaker) from time to time and will welcome your feedback there.

# Downloading and Installing

It is strongly suggested that you avoid downloading Elstob from commercial sites,
as these do not generally offer the latest version, and some downloads may carry
viruses.

For the Mac, a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package is available. Use this if
possible, as it will simplify updating to the latest version.

For Linux users, packages exist for Debian, Arch Linux, Parrot, and others. Check
your distribution for availability.

Windows users, Mac users who cannot use Homebrew, and Linux users whose distributions
do not offer Elstob should download from
[this site](https://github.com/psb1558/Elstob-font/releases/) and follow the
instructions for installing on their systems.

# Building

To build Elstob, you will need Python 3.7 or later. It is best to create a
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) in which to
run the build script and install any Python-based dependencies in the environment.

The build script, `build_font`, is a bash script, which you can run in a Mac OS,
Linux, or other similar terminal. The script depends on several utilities
available in all such systems: grep, sed (on the Mac, install gsed via Homebrew),
and xsltproc. In addition, you will need [fontmake](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontmake)
and its dependencies. If you want the variable fonts to be hinted, install
[Xgridfit 3](https://github.com/psb1558/xgridfit-3) (to install, follow the
instructions at the site). If you are generating
TrueType (.ttf) static fonts and want them to be hinted, install 'ttfautohint`
(available in Linux repositories and via Homebrew). If you are generating CFF
(.otf) static fonts and want them to be hinted, use `pip` to install `psautohint`.
If you want to generate `woff2` webfonts, install `woff2_config`

To run `build_font`, open a terminal, navigate to the `source` directory, make the file `build_font` executable
(`chmod +x build_font`), and run it to display the help text, `./build_font -h`,
which will tell you  how to build the various flavors of Elstob.

By default, the script builds variable fonts. To build static TrueType fonts
(the most common kind, with the suffix `.ttf`),  use the `-t` option; to build
static CFF fonts (with the suffix `.otf`), use the `o` option.

If you want to rename the font (like “ElstobD,” the desktop version of Elstob),
use the `-f` option to specify another family name. Other options control
hinting and other details of font generation.

If you are building static fonts, you may customize a couple of aspects while building.
The `-s` option controls the slant of the italic. Supply a number between 0 and
15, where 0 is steeply slanted (in fact, the slant of the original typeface)
and 15 is nearly upright. The `-p` option controls the width of the space
character. Supply a number between 0 and 1, where 0 produces a narrow space
(in the modern fashion), and 1 produces a wider space, as in old books printed
with metal type.

Once you have decided on your options, run the script once for each Glyphs
file: `Elstob.glyphs` and `Elstob-Italic.glyphs`.

Some examples. To build a variable font with Xgridfit printing:
```
./build_font Elstob.glyphs
```
To build a minimal collection of TrueType italic static fonts with the family
name ElstobD and a relatively upright style:
```
./build_font -t -i -s 12 -f ElstobD Elstob-Italic.glyphs
```
